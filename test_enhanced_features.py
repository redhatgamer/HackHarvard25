===================================

📸 Screenshot Info:
  • Resolution: 1920x1080
  • Format: RGB
  • Timestamp: 2025-10-04 19:30:15

🔧 Technical Insights:
  • Environment: Development
  • Language: Python
  • Complexity: Medium
  • Code Quality: Good

⚠️ Detected Issues:
  • High memory usage: 85.2%
  • Unused imports detected
  • Long function detected (>50 lines)

💡 Optimization Suggestions:
  • Consider using code analysis tools
  • Remove unused imports
  • Break down complex functions
  • Close unused applications
  • Add type hints for better clarity

🤖 AI Analysis:
I can see you're working on a Python application with VS Code. 
The code structure looks good, but there are some optimization 
opportunities. Consider refactoring the main function and adding 
proper error handling...

🛠️ Suggested Actions:
  1. Run: pylint your_file.py
  2. Add: type hints
  3. Refactor: main() function
  4. Clean: unused imports
  5. Test: edge cases
