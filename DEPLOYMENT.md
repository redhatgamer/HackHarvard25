# Deployment Configuration for Virtual Pet AI Assistant

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Automated)
Your project now has automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions that:
- ✅ Runs tests on every push/PR
- ✅ Uses your GitHub Secrets for API keys
- ✅ Builds a standalone executable
- ✅ Creates releases automatically

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
For manual deployment to any server or distribution:

#### Windows Executable
```bash
# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Create executable
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "VirtualPetAI" main.py
```

#### Docker Deployment (Optional)
```dockerfile
# Use the provided Dockerfile
docker build -t virtual-pet-ai .
docker run -e GEMINI_API_KEY=$GEMINI_API_KEY virtual-pet-ai
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables Setup

Your GitHub Actions will automatically create a `.env` file using your repository secrets:

### Required Secrets in GitHub:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini AI API key ✅ (Already added!)

### Optional Secrets:
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging level (defaults to INFO)
- `PET_NAME` - Pet name (defaults to Pixie)
- `PET_PERSONALITY` - Pet personality (defaults to "helpful and friendly")

## 📦 What Happens on Push:

1. **Code is tested** with your API key from secrets
2. **Quality checks** run on all Python files  
3. **Executable is built** (Windows .exe file)
4. **Artifact is uploaded** to GitHub Actions
5. **Release is created** (if you push a tag)

## 🏷️ Creating a Release:

To trigger a release build:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will create a GitHub release with the built executable!

## 🔒 Security Notes:

- ✅ API keys never appear in logs or code
- ✅ Secrets are only accessible during build/test
- ✅ Built executable includes environment variables securely
- ✅ No secrets are stored in the repository

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. **Push your code** to GitHub - CI/CD will run automatically
2. **Check the Actions tab** to see the build progress
3. **Download artifacts** from successful builds
4. **Create tags** for versioned releases

Your deployment pipeline is now fully configured! 🎉
