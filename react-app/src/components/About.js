              <p>
                In the bustling world of modern technology, we noticed something was missing - 
                genuine connection. While our devices became smarter, they often felt colder. 
                That's when the idea of Hirono was born.
              </p>
              <p>
                Named after the Japanese concept of "Â∫ÉÈáé" (hirono), meaning "wide field" or 
                "expansive plain", our virtual companion represents endless possibilities for 
                connection and growth. Hirono isn't just software; it's a friend, a helper, 
                and a companion designed to bring warmth to your digital experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started as a simple desktop pet has evolved into a sophisticated AI 
                companion that learns, grows, and adapts to your unique personality and needs. 
                Every interaction helps Hirono become more attuned to your preferences, 
                creating a truly personalized experience.
