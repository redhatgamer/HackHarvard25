## 🎮 How to Resize Your Pet

Your pet can now be resized in multiple ways!

### **🖱️ Mouse Wheel (Easiest)**
- **Scroll up** on your pet = Make it bigger 🔍
- **Scroll down** on your pet = Make it smaller 🔎

### **⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts**
- **+ key** = Make bigger
- **- key** = Make smaller  
- **0 key** = Reset to default size (120x120)

### **🖱️ Right-Click Menu**
Right-click on your pet to see:
- 🔍 **Make Bigger** - Increase size by 20px
- 🔎 **Make Smaller** - Decrease size by 20px  
- 📏 **Reset Size** - Back to default (120x120)

## 📐 Size Limits
- **Minimum**: 50x50 pixels (so it doesn't disappear!)
- **Maximum**: 500x500 pixels (so it doesn't take over your screen!)
