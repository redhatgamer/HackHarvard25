## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### UI Loop Optimization
```python
async def _run_ui_loop(self):
    frame_time = 1/30  # 30 FPS instead of 100 FPS
    while self.is_running:
        frame_start = time.time()
        self.root.update()
        
        # Adaptive sleep to maintain consistent frame rate
        elapsed = time.time() - frame_start
        sleep_time = max(0.001, frame_time - elapsed)
        await asyncio.sleep(sleep_time)
```

### Memory Management
```python
# Memory limits in constructor
self.MAX_CONVERSATION_HISTORY = 50
self.MAX_ACTIVITY_HISTORY = 20

# Automatic cleanup
if len(self.conversation_history) > self.MAX_CONVERSATION_HISTORY:
    self.conversation_history = self.conversation_history[-self.MAX_CONVERSATION_HISTORY:]
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Performance monitoring with thresholds
self.performance_monitor = PerformanceMonitor(config)
self.performance_monitor.start_monitoring()

# Automatic warnings for:
# - Memory usage > 200MB
# - CPU usage > 15%
# - Frame times > 100ms
# - AI responses > 10s
```

## üìà Expected Benefits
